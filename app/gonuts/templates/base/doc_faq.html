Why nut command forces me to add LICENSE file?</h3>

Code without a license is copyrighted and proprietary by default. No-one can legally use it for any reason.
If you don't care about licenses, but want to make your code open-source,
please apply a simple permissive human-readable <a href="http://mit-license.org/">MIT-style license</a>.
